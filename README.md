# Rider Game

This is a simple racing game developed using Pygame. The game allows two players to control their cars and race against each other on a track. The objective is to reach the finish line and score points. The first player to score 3 points wins the game.

## Features
- Two-player racing game
- Customizable car controls
- Collision detection with track borders and finish line
- Scoring system to keep track of each player's score
- Game over screen displaying the winner

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository or download the game files.
2. Make sure you have Pygame installed on your system.
3. Run the game using Python.
4. Use the following controls to play the game:
   - Player 1 (Red Car):
     - Left arrow key: Rotate car left
     - Right arrow key: Rotate car right
     - Up arrow key: Move car forward
     - Down arrow key: Move car backward

   - Player 2 (Blue Car):
     - A key: Rotate car left
     - D key: Rotate car right
     - W key: Move car forward
     - S key: Move car backward

5. Avoid collisions with the track borders to prevent bouncing back.
6. Reach the finish line to score points. Each player can score once per timeout period.
7. The game ends when one player reaches a score of 3. The winner is displayed on the screen.

## Game Features (Not Implemented)
While the current version of the Rider Game provides an enjoyable racing experience, there are several additional features that could be considered for future development:

- Multiple Levels: The game currently features a single track. Adding multiple levels with different designs and challenges would enhance gameplay variety.
- Game Modes: Introducing different game modes, such as time trial, lap race, or elimination, would provide players with diverse gameplay experiences.
- Power-ups: Including power-ups on the track, such as speed boosts or temporary invincibility, would add excitement and strategic elements to the gameplay.
- AI Opponents: Adding AI-controlled cars as opponents would enable single-player gameplay and allow players to compete against computer-controlled opponents.
- Online Multiplayer: Implementing online multiplayer functionality would enable players to compete with friends or other players worldwide.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pygame

## Game Assets
The game requires the following assets placed in the "assets" directory:
- "track.png": Track image
- "track-border.png": Track border image
- "finish-line.png": Finish line image
- "red-car.png": Image of the red car
- "blue-car.png": Image of the blue car
- "SHOWG.ttf": Font file for displaying text

Note: You can customize the game assets by replacing the existing files with your own images or fonts.

## Development
The game code is written in Python using the Pygame library. It consists of two classes: `PlayerRedCar` and `PlayerBlueCar`, representing the red and blue cars, respectively. The game logic is implemented in the main loop, which handles user input, car movement, collision detection, scoring, and rendering of the game screen.
